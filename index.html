    <p>
      I can see it in your eyes, you're angry Regret got shit on what you're feeling no Mad 'cause he ain't like me Oh you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me All the care I would take, all the love that we made Now you're trying to find somebody
      to replace what I gave to you
    </p>

    <p>
      It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
      I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
      Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man
      Don't you forget it
      The way you walk, that's me...
      The way you talk, that's me...
      The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?...
      And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me...
      And the voice in your ear, that's me
      Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
      First I made you who you are, then I made it
      And you're wasted with your ladies
      Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded
    </p>

    <p>
      Take a shot for me, ooh
      Take a shot for me, ooh
      Take a shot for me
      A shot for me
      A shot for me
    </p>

    <p>
      Okay look, I'm honest
      Girl I can't lie, I miss you
      You and the music were the only things that I commit to
      I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
      But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
      She says I know you changed, I never see you
      'Cause you're always busy doing things
    </p>

    <p>
      I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
      I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
      It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
      The men are jealous and the women all in competition
      And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
      And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
    </p>

    <p>
      I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
      Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
      This is one I know you hated when you heard it
      And it's worse because you know that I deserve it
    </p>

    <p>
      Take a shot for me, ooh
      Take a shot for me, ooh
      Take a shot for me
      A shot for me
      A shot for me
    </p>

    <p>
      May your neighbors respect you
      Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
      And heaven accept you
    </p>
